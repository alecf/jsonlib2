#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

jsonlib2 is almost a drop-in replacement for simplejson - at least that's how we use it at [http://www.freebase.com/ Freebase]. We use the more common features, and this library does its best to support a few more.

= Supported API =

== dump[s] ==

* ensure_ascii
* allow_nan
* indent
* separators
* default

== load[s] ==

* parse_float
* parse_int
* parse_constant

= Not yet supported =

== load[s] ==
* skipkeys - probably quite easy to implement
* check_circular - probably quite easy to implement
* cls - really might not be possible, due to C implementation
* encoding - may be a big pain in the neck, because much of the code makes a lot of UTF8 assumptions.

== dump[s] ==

* encoding - again, might be a pain in the neck
* cls - again, might not be possible due to C implementation
* object_hook - probably quite easy to implement
