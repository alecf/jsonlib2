#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

jsonlib2 is almost a drop-in replacement for simplejson - at least that's how we use it at [http://www.freebase.com/ Freebase]. We use the more common features, and this library does its best to support a few more.

= Supported API =

== dump/dumps ==

  * ensure_ascii
  * allow_nan
  * indent
  * separators
  * default

== load/loads ==

  * parse_float
  * parse_int
  * parse_constant

= API differences =

a few keywords are not supported, but more importantly, jsonlib2 tends to output 8-bit strings so that they can be dumped directly through HTTP rather than make a 2nd conversion back 

== dump/dumps ==
  * skipkeys - probably quite easy to implement
  * check_circular - probably quite easy to implement
  * cls - really might not be possible, due to C implementation
  * encoding - may be a big pain in the neck, because much of the code makes a lot of UTF8 assumptions.

== load/loads ==

  * encoding - again, might be a pain in the neck
  * cls - again, might not be possible due to C implementation
  * object_hook - probably quite easy to implement
